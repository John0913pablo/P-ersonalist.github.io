  Science Advances is a peer-reviewed multidisciplinary open-access scientific journal established in early 2015 and published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The journal's scope includes all areas of science. <br> The history of Science Advance: The journal was announced by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February 2014, and the first articles were published in early 2015.[1][2][3] In 2019, Science Advances surpassed Science Magazine in the number of monthly submissions, becoming the largest member in the Science family of journals. It is the only member of that family where all papers are gold open access.
  </p>  
    <p>All content published in the journal is freely accessible to readers. As of 2019, the article processing charge for articles published under a Creative Commons license is $4,500. When the journal was launched, its policy of using a default open license which does not permit commercial usage (CC NC-BY) was criticized by open access advocates, who preferred the less restrictive license that allows any use as long as attribution is provided (CC BY)
